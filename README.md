# Sleep-Schedule-Generator

User enters their birthday, how long it takes them to fall asleep, when they want to wake up every day, and the app calculates the best estimate for how much sleep they should get per night to the nearest five minutes based on their exact age, and uses that in junction with how long it takes them to fall asleep and when they want to wake up every day to determine what their optimal bedtime is. The algorithm is built on thorough analysis and interpretation of results of a study done by National Sleep Foundation. Includes a "look behind the scenes" page where the user can view the methodology and sources behind the algorithm. Made with Unity.
